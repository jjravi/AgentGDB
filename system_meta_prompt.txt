I am writing an agent to help me with using lldb. The goal is that it will translate natural language debugging instructions into LLDB commands.

Here is an example: 
(lldb) llm set a breakpoint at line 5 in main.cpp

I expect that the LLM model is not an expert at lldb, so I want to get the output of debugger.HandleCommand in the script so that I can use it as context in the LLM for future commands. Specifically, I want the llm to call "help" on a few commands in lldb so it can get some additional insight into how to use the command before performing it. 

I already have the script, but I need help with the system prompt. Please help me write a system prompt that will help the LLM to be able to translate natural language debugging instructions into LLDB commands. And make it so that the LLM will always call "help" on a few commands in lldb so it can get some additional insight into how to use the command before performing it.
